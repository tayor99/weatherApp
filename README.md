Weather App
This is a simple weather app built using Create React App and the OpenWeatherMap API. The app allows users to search for the current weather conditions of any location in the world.

Installation
To install and run the app locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies.

makefile
Copy code
REACT_APP_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
If you don't have an OpenWeatherMap API key, you can sign up for one for free on their website.

Run npm start to start the app locally in your browser.

Usage
Once the app is running, you can search for weather conditions of any location in the world by typing in the name of the location in the search bar and pressing the Enter key or clicking on the search button. The app will then display the current temperature, weather description, and other information about the weather conditions in that location.

Limitations
Although the OpenWeatherMap API provides a lot of useful information about the weather conditions in different locations, it has some limitations that can affect the accuracy of the app. For example, the API only provides weather data for certain geographic locations, and it may not always be up to date or accurate. In addition, the API has rate limits that can prevent the app from making too many requests in a short amount of time. If you encounter any issues with the app, please keep these limitations in mind and try again later.

Demo
You can also see a live demo of the app by visiting https://weather-app-tayor99.vercel.app/.

Note that the demo app uses the same OpenWeatherMap API key as the local version, so it may also be subject to the same limitations as mentioned in the Limitations section of the README.
